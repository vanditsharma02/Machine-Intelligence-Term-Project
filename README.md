# Machine-Intelligence-Term-Project
Our term project for Machine Intelligence and Expert Systems Assignments (EC60091) Autumn 2020 at IIT Kharagpur. Screenshot of the Problem Statement has been provided below.
Analyzing effect of mood of a person on keystroke dynamics
and mouse dynamics for imposter detection
Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral biometric which is used to authenticate a user. Primarily,
two features i.e. hold time of an individual key and the latency of the consecutive keystrokes are
used for authentication.
Mouse Dynamics is another behavioral biometric which is used to authenticate a user. A mousestroke is defined to be the set of points traversed from one click to the next and a set of one or
more strokes are used in order to verify a user.
